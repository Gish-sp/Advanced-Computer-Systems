# Advanced Computer Systems

## Project 1:
### Cache and Memory Performance Profiling:

The objective of this project is to gain deeper understanding of cache and memory hierarchy in modern computers. 

## Project 2: 
### Dense/Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
The objective of this design project is to implement a C/C++ module that carries out high-speed dense/sparse
matrix-matrix multiplication by explicitly utilizing (i) multiple threads, (ii) x86 SIMD instructions, and/or (iii)
techniques to minimize cache miss rate via restructuring data access patterns or data compression (as discussed in
class). Matrix-matrix multiplication is one of the most important data processing kernels in numerous real-life
applications, e.g., machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, and scientific computing.
